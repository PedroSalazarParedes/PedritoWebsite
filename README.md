ðŸš€ðŸ¦•

## Getting Started

This is my personal website. It can be accessed via this url: https://pedrosalazarparedes.github.io/PedritoWebsite/. It was developed using regular web-dev techniques and libraries.

### Prerequisites

In order to use this product no strange things are needed as most of the complicated resources are hosted at public CDNs. It uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Coding Style

The code in this project is W3 compliant and was tested with ESlint for possible mistakes. The JavaScript code for the typing effect was written by me.
